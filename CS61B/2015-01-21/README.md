## Notes
- All Java programs are object oriented

- Java is statically typed
    - Before a variable can be used, it must be given a permanent type
    - Functions have a declared return type
    - Before a program ever runs, its types are all checked and the program does not run if they are bad

    - Good:
        - You can catch errors before the user runs program
        - Its easier to reason about what your pgraom is doing
        - Code will run faster and more efficiently

    - Bade:
        -Verbosity
